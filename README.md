## Blood Bank Management System 
- The Blood Bank Management System is designed to manage the records of blood donors, blood requests, and blood inventory in an efficient manner. 
- The system ensures that blood banks can maintain accurate records, streamline the blood donation process, and fulfill blood requests promptly.
- Technologies used :- Java, JDBC, JSP, Apache Tomcat, MYSQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

  ## Technologies Used
Frontend:
- JSP (JavaServer Pages): Used to create dynamic web pages where users can interact with the system.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Used for designing the user interface.
  
Backend:
- Java & Advanced Java: Core logic and business layer of the application are built using Java, implementing various design patterns for scalability and maintainability.
- JDBC: Java Database Connectivity is used for interaction between Java code and the MySQL database.
  
Server:
- Apache Tomcat: Serves as the web server for deploying the JSP pages and handling HTTP requests and responses.
  
Database:
- MySQL: Used to store data related to donors, blood inventory, blood requests, and other related information.
  
## Modules and Features
 1 Admin Module:
- Login: Secure login for administrators.
- Manage Donors: Add, update, or delete donor details.
- Manage Blood Inventory: Monitor and update the status of blood inventory.
- Manage Requests: View and approve/reject blood requests from hospitals or individuals.
- Reports: Generate reports on blood inventory, donors, and blood requests.
  
2 Donor Module:
- Registration: Donors can register by providing their details such as name, blood type, and contact information.
- Donation History: Donors can view their past donations.
- Profile Management: Update personal details.
  
3 Request Module:
- Blood Request: Hospitals or individuals can request blood by specifying the required blood group.
- Request Status: Check the status of a blood request.
  
4 User Module:
- Search Donors: Search for donors by blood type and location.
- Blood Availability: Check the availability of specific blood types in the inventory.
- Contact Information: View contact details of available donors or the blood bank.
  
## System Flow
- User Interaction: Users interact with the system through JSP pages, which are served by the Tomcat server.
- Processing: The JSP pages make requests to the Java backend, where the core business logic is implemented.
- Database Interaction: The Java backend interacts with the MySQL database via JDBC to store, retrieve, and update data.
- Response: The backend sends the processed data back to the JSP pages, which then display the relevant information to the user.
  
## Security and Performance
- Authentication & Authorization: Implemented to ensure that only authorized personnel can access the admin module.
- Data Validation: Ensures that all inputs from users are validated to prevent errors and security vulnerabilities.
- Optimization: Queries and server-side processes are optimized for performance to handle large volumes of data efficiently.
  
## Deployment
- Tomcat Server: The application is deployed on Apache Tomcat, which handles requests and serves the application to users.
- Database Hosting: MySQL database is hosted on a server accessible by the application for real-time data access and updates.
